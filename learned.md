#  What have I learned?

Having recently started the full stack bootcamp with Black Codher, these are the things I've learnt about so far:

- the software development life cycle, 
- the different approaches to dealing with the software life cyle it, 
- Agile and it's different frameworks,  
- git,
- git commands and 
- the purpose of source control. 

I've managed to follow the content so far and look forward to future challenges!
